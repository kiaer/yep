\section{Conclusion}

Using Otago Harbour as a proxy for SST in the areas where yellow-eyed penguins are seen is valid. Looking at the correlation map, the temperatures near the coastline of New Zealand all have a strong correlation of around $\approx 0.8$ to the data from Otago Harbour. As SST only explains around 33\% of the variation in population survival according to \cite{mattern}, the possible link between die-off events and both chlorophyll concentrations and the position of the nearby frontal zone was investigated.

The chlorophyll data time series is shorter than SST and only two major die-off can be compared to the chlorophyll concentration. The events of 2001 and 2012 happened at two very different seasons. While the 2000/2001 season saw very low chlorophyll concentrations, the 2011/2012 season was generally one of the most productive seasons seen. The delayed effect of chlorophyll concentrations was not investigated.

The position of the Subtropical front could not immediately explain any of the die-off events that have happened in 1989, 2001 or 2012 but the positioning of the frontal zones showed interesting results when comparing it with the foraging patterns of the penguins studied by \cite{mattern2013}. Even though a comparison of foraging patterns and position of frontal zone only could be done for 3 years, it might be of interest to further investigate whether or not the position of frontal zone could explain these patterns and the breeding success within the population.

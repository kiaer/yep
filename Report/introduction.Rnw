\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Background from project description}
The yellow-eyed Penguin is a penguin found only in certain areas of New Zealand. The penguins are on the ICUN red list, seen as an endangered species. With an estimation of only 1700 breeding pairs left and increasing numbers of dead birds found, research into the cause of the yearly variation in stock is of high importance. Quantifying climate change impacts emphasises the importance of managing regional threats in the endangered Yellow-eyed penguin written by Mattern et. al [2017] states that 33pct of the variation in population numbers could be explained by sea surface temperatures (SST) alone using a Bayesian model. The article also discusses whether non-climatic factors could be better at describing the variations in the population of the Yellow-eyed penguin and states that lack of data makes it impossible to assess. Mattern et. al [2017] uses climate data from a nearby port as a proxy for the Yellow-eyed penguins natural habitat, which can cast some doubt about the results of the paper.

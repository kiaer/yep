abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater} Climate change is a global issue with effects that are difficult to manage at a regional scale. Yet more often than not climate factors are just some of multiple stressors affecting species on a population level. Non-climatic factors—especially those of anthropogenic origins—may play equally important roles with regard to impacts on species and are often more feasible to address. Here we assess the influence of climate change on population trends of the endangered Yellow-eyed penguin ( {\textless}italic{\textgreater}Megadyptes antipodes{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} ) over the last 30 years, using a Bayesian model. Sea surface temperature (SST) proved to be the dominating factor influencing survival of both adult birds and fledglings. Increasing SST since the mid-1990s was accompanied by a reduction in survival rates and population decline. The population model showed that 33{\%} of the variation in population numbers could be explained by SST alone, significantly increasing pressure on the penguin population. Consequently, the population becomes less resilient to non-climate related impacts, such as fisheries interactions, habitat degradation and human disturbance. However, the extent of the contribution of these factors to declining population trends is extremely difficult to assess principally due to the absence of quantifiable data, creating a discussion bias towards climate variables, and effectively distracting from non-climate factors that can be managed on a regional scale to ensure the viability of the population. {\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

    abstract = { ABSTRACT We investigated an epidemic mortality cluster of yellow-eyed penguins (Megadyptes antipodes) that involved 67 moribund or dead birds found on various beaches of the Otago Peninsula, New Zealand, between 21 January and 20 March 2013. Twenty-four carcases were examined post-mortem. Histological lesions of pulmonary, hepatic and splenic erythrophagocytosis and haemosiderosis were found in 23 of 24 birds. Fifteen birds also had haemoglobin-like protein droplets within renal tubular epithelial cells. Despite consistent histological lesions, a cause of death could not be established. Virology, bacteriology and molecular tests for avian influenza, avian paramyxovirus-1, avipoxvirus, Chlamydia psittaci, Plasmodium spp., Babesia spp., Leucocytozoon spp. and Toxoplasma gondii were negative. Tissue concentrations of a range of heavy metals (n=4 birds) were consistent with low level exposure, while examination of proventricular contents and mucus failed to detect any marine biotoxins or Clostridium botulinum toxin. Hepatic concentrations of total polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) (n=5 birds) were similar to background concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons previously found in yellow-eyed penguins from the South Island of New Zealand, but there were significantly higher concentrations of 1-methylnapthelene and 2-methylnapthelene in the birds found dead in this mortality cluster. The biological significance of this finding is unclear. A temporal investigation of the epidemic did not indicate either a common source or propagative epidemic pattern. Although our investigation did not definitively implicate a toxic or infectious agent, we could not rule out causes such as toxic marine organisms or mycoplasmosis. Further investigations should therefore by carried out in the event of future mortality clusters. }

abstract = {Conservation of yellow-eyed penguins ( Megadyptes antipodes) on the New Zealand mainland requires accurate data on population trend, annual variation in survival, and several other parameters that can be estimated from banding data. We describe initial analyses using a newly constructed database of yellow- eyed penguin breeding and banding data, maintained by Manaaki Whenua. All known banding records of fledglings, juveniles and adults (n = 5894, 1972- 1994) are tabulated by year for 46 mainland breeding areas and three southern islands (Codfish, Enderby and Campbell). Annual survival and recruitment were analysed for the intensively studied Double Bay and Midsection areas on Otago Peninsula. Adult survival varied between 49{\%} and 100{\%} over the 1982/83 - 1992/93 period; excluding one year of extraordinarily high mortality (1989/90), the lowest annual adult survival rate was 80{\%} in 1985/86 - 1986/87. The average adult survival rate (83 +/- 13{\%}) did not differ significantly from that reported 45 years earlier. The proportion of banded fledglings resighted as adults varied between 1 {\%} and 38{\%} in different cohorts, and almost half were resighted at an area other than their natal area. Mark-recapture estimates of total adult population showed no recovery from the 1989-90 catastrophe by the 1992-93 breeding season. We demonstrate that adult yellow-eyed penguins are likely to be male when the sum of head length and foot length exceeds 269 mm. The 14{\%} error rate by this criterion may be further reduced to about 2{\%} by measuring both birds of a definitely mated heterosexual pair and considering the larger to be the male. The proportion of adult-aged birds breeding in any year was extremely variable (30{\%} - 90{\%}); care must therefore be taken when applying Richdale's "60{\%}" rule of thumb for extrapolating the total population from the number of nests. We are unable to estimate separately the non-breeding rates of males and females as prior to 1992 relatively few adults were measured for sexing. We propose a new system of paper record forms for use by field workers.},

This current has been studied many times since the early 1960s, with particular emphasis on an associated narrow coastal band of warm, salty water of subtropical origin, separated from offshore cold, fresh Subantarctic Water (SAW) by the Southland Front. Previous works on the Southland Current state that it advects modified warm, salty Subtropical Water (STW). This work quantifies the relative proportions of SAW and STW within the current. The Southland Current has a mean transport of 8.3 Sv comprising c. 90{\%} SAW and 10{\%} STW. The mean properties advected result from the current extending offshore of the Southland Front: in fact the core of the current is offshore of the Southland Front.}}

abstract = { Abstract Current meter moorings were deployed in six locations around the South Island, New Zealand, in 1993 to monitor the Southland Current. Off the eastern shelf of the South Island, the Southland Current is unidirectional, but variable in speed. Mean flows during 6 months at the 100 m isobath off Oamaru and Nugget Pt were 14.4 and 23.8 cm s^(-1), respectively, with standard deviations of 9 and 14.8 cm s^(-1). Flows south of Stewart Island, over the Snares Plateau, are more isotropic and considerably weaker, with mean flows typically 3-5 cm s^(-1). Currents off Oamaru are correlated with those off Nugget Pt, and the dispersion relationship calculated between them indicates phase and group propagation to the north-east along the coast comparable to that expected for coastally-trapped waves (CTW). Currents in Foveaux St are strongly wind-driven, but currents over the Snares Plateau show almost no coherence with the Invercargill wind. An empirical model, using the currents over the Snares Plateau and the Invercargill wind as inputs, can explain up to 0.76 of the variance of the Southland Current. }}

abstract = {Abstract The identification of demographically independent populations and the recognition of management units have been greatly facilitated by the continuing advances in genetic tools. Managements units now play a key role in short-term conservation management programmes of declining species, but their importance in expanding populations receives comparatively little attention. The endangered yellow-eyed penguin (Megadyptes antipodes) expanded its range from the subantarctic to New Zealand's South Island a few hundred years ago and this new population now represents almost half of the species total census size. This dramatic expansion attests to M. antipodes high dispersal abilities and suggests the species is likely to constitute a single demographic population. Here we test this hypothesis of panmixia by investigating genetic differentiation and levels of gene flow among penguin breeding areas using 12 autosomal microsatellite loci along with mitochondrial control region sequence analyses for 350 individuals. Contrary to our hypothesis, however, the analyses reveal two genetically and geographically distinct assemblages: South Island vs. subantarctic populations. Using assignment tests, we recognize just two first-generation migrants between these populations (corresponding to a migration rate of {<2\%}), indicating that ongoing levels of long-distance migration are low. Furthermore, the South Island population has low genetic variability compared to the subantarctic population. These results suggest that the South Island population was founded by only a small number of individuals, and that subsequent levels of gene flow have remained low. The demographic independence of the two populations warrants their designation as distinct management units and conservation efforts should be adjusted accordingly to protect both populations.}

If linear movement patterns occur they are usually associated with travelling events or migratory behaviour. However, recent fine scale tracking of flying seabirds has revealed straight-line movements while birds followed fishing vessels. Unlike flying seabirds, penguins are not known to target and follow fishing vessels. Yet yellow-eyed penguins from New Zealand often exhibit directed movement patterns while searching for prey at the seafloor, a behaviour that seems to contradict common movement ecology theories. While deploying GPS dive loggers on yellow-eyed penguins from the Otago Peninsula we found that the birds frequently followed straight lines for several kilometres with little horizontal deviation. In several cases individuals swam up and down the same line, while some of the lines were followed by more than one individual. Using a remote operated vehicle (ROV) we found a highly visible furrow on the seafloor most likely caused by an otter board of a demersal fish trawl, which ran in a straight line exactly matching the trajectory of a recent line identified from penguin tracks. We noted high abundances of benthic scavengers associated with fisheries-related bottom disturbance. While our data demonstrate the acute way-finding capabilities of benthic foraging yellow-eyed penguins, they also highlight how hidden cascading effects of coastal fisheries may alter behaviour and potentially even population dynamics of marine predators, an often overlooked fact in the examination of fisheries impacts.},

Diet composition, meal sizes and energetic content of meals and prey were determined from stomach contents, and stable isotope analyses of chick down, fledgling feathers and adult blood provided information on diet throughout the fledging period. The high proportion of stomachs that were empty or lacked diagnostic remains reduced sample size considerably, and variability between samples reduced the power to detect significant differences in meal size, proportions of empty stomachs and prey diversity of meals. Energetic content of Stewart Island meals was less than Codfish Island meals, and there was a non-significant trend for smaller meal sizes and reduced prey diversity among Stewart Island samples. Both localities had lower prey diversity and smaller meals than South Island penguins. Blue cod Parapercis colias accounted for 99{\%} of prey biomass in Stewart Island and 70{\%} in Codfish Island stomach samples, where 27{\%} of prey biomass was opalfish Hemerocoetes monopterygius. Isotopic mixing models carried out on larger sample sizes indicated that opalfish comprised a large proportion of the diet at both locations, with adults selectively provisioning chicks with opalfish while feeding mainly on blue cod themselves. We suggest the large blue cod consumed by Codfish Island and Stewart Island penguins, larger than those consumed by South Island penguins, is difficult to transfer to chicks by regurgitation. Oyster dredging around Stewart Island may have reduced the availability and abundance of alternative prey to Stewart Island penguins.}

@article{mattern2007,
abstract = {Yellow-eyed penguins Megadyptes antipodes seemingly forage at discrete marine locations over the continental shelf, where they are believed to feed predominantly at the seafloor. Such behaviour would distinguish them from most other penguin species that generally employ pelagic foraging strategies. From 2003 to 2005 we studied the foraging behaviour of yellow-eyed penguins breeding near Oamaru, New Zealand. We used 2 types of data loggers: GPS loggers recorded geographical position and dive depth at set intervals, while time-depth recorders (TDRs) recorded only dive depth. The penguins performed day trips (range: 12 to 20 km from the coast) or shorter evening trips (range: <7 km). Consecutive foraging trips of individuals revealed remarkably consistent foraging routes. Birds travelled along similar—at times congruent—paths, markedly changed course at distinct locations, and revisited certain locations on separate trips, indicating skilful navigation. Three trip stages could be distinguished on one-day trips. During the outgoing (seaward travelling) and incoming (shoreward travelling) stages the birds followed linear courses. These stages were separated by a period of midday activity in which birds exhibited higher dive effort and often tended to stay within confined areas. The diving behaviour revealed an exclusive bottom-foraging strategy, with 87\% of all dives being benthic dives; the majority of non-benthic dives occurred during the last 2 to 3 h of the trip, indicating primarily travelling behaviour. Furthermore, yellow-eyed penguins employ benthic dives not only when feeding but also frequently when travelling. We suggest that benthic dives might facilitate navigation and, consequently, account for the consistent foraging patterns of yellow-eyed penguins.},

abstract = {Abstract Seafloor organisms are vital for healthy marine ecosystems, contributing to elemental cycling, benthic remineralization, and ultimately sequestration of carbon. Deep-sea life is primarily reliant on the export flux of particulate organic carbon from the surface ocean for food, but most ocean biogeochemistry models predict global decreases in export flux resulting from 21st century anthropogenically induced warming. Here we show that decadal-to-century scale changes in carbon export associated with climate change lead to an estimated 5.2\% decrease in future (2091-2100) global open ocean benthic biomass under RCP8.5 (reduction of 5.2 Mt C) compared with contemporary conditions (2006-2015). Our projections use multi-model mean export flux estimates from eight fully coupled earth system models, which contributed to the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5, that have been forced by high and low representative concentration pathways (RCP8.5 and 4.5, respectively). These export flux estimates are used in conjunction with published empirical relationships to predict changes in benthic biomass. The polar oceans and some upwelling areas may experience increases in benthic biomass, but most other regions show decreases, with up to 38\% reductions in parts of the northeast Atlantic. Our analysis projects a future ocean with smaller sized infaunal benthos, potentially reducing energy transfer rates though benthic multicellular food webs. More than 80\% of potential deep-water biodiversity hotspots known around the world, including canyons, seamounts, and cold-water coral reefs, are projected to experience negative changes in biomass. These major reductions in biomass may lead to widespread change in benthic ecosystems and the functions and services they provide.}

We show that the relative impacts of thermal and chemical energy change across organizational scales. Results suggest that individual metabolic rates, growth, and turnover proceed as quickly as temperature-influenced biochemical kinetics allow but that chemical energy limits higher-order community structure and function.

The impact of such changes in climate is least known for the deep ocean, which covers over 60\% of the earth{\textquoteright}s surface. An unprecedented 24-y time series measuring changes in food supply and utilization by benthic communities at 4,000-m depth in the deep northeast Pacific reveal strong connectivity with changing surface ocean conditions, which have broad implications for the global carbon cycle.The deep ocean, covering a vast expanse of the globe, relies almost exclusively on a food supply originating from primary production in surface waters. With well-documented warming of oceanic surface waters and conflicting reports of increasing and decreasing primary production trends, questions persist about how such changes impact deep ocean communities. A 24-y time-series study of sinking particulate organic carbon (food) supply and its utilization by the benthic community was conducted in the abyssal northeast Pacific (4,000-m depth). Here we show that previous findings of food deficits are now punctuated by large episodic surpluses of particulate organic carbon reaching the sea floor, which meet utilization. Changing surface ocean conditions are translated to the deep ocean, where decadal peaks in supply, remineralization, and sequestration of organic carbon have broad implications for global carbon budget projections.},

	Abstract = {Heatwaves are important climatic extremes in atmospheric and oceanic systems that can have devastating and long-term impacts on ecosystems, with subsequent socioeconomic consequences. Recent prominent marine heatwaves have attracted considerable scientific and public interest. Despite this, a comprehensive assessment of how these ocean temperature extremes have been changing globally is missing. Using a range of ocean temperature data including global records of daily satellite observations, daily in situ measurements and gridded monthly in situ-based data sets, we identify significant increases in marine heatwaves over the past century. We find that from 1925 to 2016, global average marine heatwave frequency and duration increased by 34{\%} and 17{\%}, respectively, resulting in a 54{\%} increase in annual marine heatwave days globally. Importantly, these trends can largely be explained by increases in mean ocean temperatures, suggesting that we can expect further increases in marine heatwave days under continued global warming.},

abstract = {Our perspective highlights potentially important links between disparate fieldsâbiological oceanography, climate change research, and experimental evolutionary biology. We focus on one important functional groupâphotoautotrophic microbes (phytoplankton), which are responsible for âŒ50\% of global primary productivity. Global climate change currently results in the simultaneous change of several conditions such as warming, acidification, and nutrient supply. It thus has the potential to dramatically change phytoplankton physiology, community composition, and may result in adaptive evolution. Although their large population sizes, standing genetic variation, and rapid turnover time should promote swift evolutionary change, oceanographers have focussed on describing patterns of present day physiological differentiation rather than measure potential adaptation in evolution experiments, the only direct way to address whether and at which rate phytoplankton species will adapt to environmental change. Important open questions are (1) is adaptation limited by existing genetic variation or fundamental constraints? (2) Will complex ecological settings such as gradual versus abrupt environmental change influence adaptation processes? (3) How will increasing environmental variability affect the evolution of phenotypic plasticity patterns? Because marine phytoplankton species display rapid acclimation capacity (phenotypic buffering), a systematic study of reaction norms renders them particularly interesting to the evolutionary biology research community.}

	abstract = {The profound influence of marine plankton on the global carbon cycle has been recognized for decades, particularly for photosynthetic microbes that form the base of ocean food chains. However, a comprehensive model of the carbon cycle is challenged by unicellular eukaryotes (protists) having evolved complex behavioral strategies and organismal interactions that extend far beyond photosynthetic lifestyles. As is also true for multicellular eukaryotes, these strategies and their associated physiological changes are difficult to deduce from genome sequences or gene repertoires{\textemdash}a problem compounded by numerous unknown function proteins. Here, we explore protistan trophic modes in marine food webs and broader biogeochemical influences. We also evaluate approaches that could resolve their activities, link them to biotic and abiotic factors, and integrate them into an ecosystems biology framework.},

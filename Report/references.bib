	abstract = {As a global issue the effects of climate change are difficult to manage on a region scale. However, more often than not it is only one of many problems that need to be addressed in species conservation. Non-climatic factors - especially those of anthropogenic origins - play equally if not more important roles with regards to population developments of species and often provide much better toeholds for conservation activities. We examined the population trends of the endangered Yellow-eyed penguin (Megadyptes antipodes) in New Zealand using monitoring data dating back to the 1980s. We developed a Bayesian population model incorporating various climatic factors to assess the relative influence of climate change on the penguin numbers over the past 30 years. Sea surface temperature (SST) proved to be the dominating factor influencing survival of both adult birds and fledglings. Increasing SST since the mid-1990s went along with a reduction in survival rates and population decline. The population model showed that 33\% of the variation in population numbers could be explained by SST alone, significantly increasing pressure on the penguin population. Consequently, the population becomes less resilient to non-climate related impacts, such as fisheries interactions, habitat degradation and human disturbance. But their exact contribution towards population trends is extremely difficult to assess principally due to the absence of quantifiable data. This potentially creates an analysis bias towards climate variables, effectively distracting from non-climate factors that can be managed on a regional scale to ensure the viability of the population.},

    abstract = { ABSTRACTWe investigated an epidemic mortality cluster of yellow-eyed penguins (Megadyptes antipodes) that involved 67 moribund or dead birds found on various beaches of the Otago Peninsula, New Zealand, between 21 January and 20 March 2013. Twenty-four carcases were examined post-mortem. Histological lesions of pulmonary, hepatic and splenic erythrophagocytosis and haemosiderosis were found in 23 of 24 birds. Fifteen birds also had haemoglobin-like protein droplets within renal tubular epithelial cells. Despite consistent histological lesions, a cause of death could not be established. Virology, bacteriology and molecular tests for avian influenza, avian paramyxovirus-1, avipoxvirus, Chlamydia psittaci, Plasmodium spp., Babesia spp., Leucocytozoon spp. and Toxoplasma gondii were negative. Tissue concentrations of a range of heavy metals (n=4 birds) were consistent with low level exposure, while examination of proventricular contents and mucus failed to detect any marine biotoxins or Clostridium botulinum toxin. Hepatic concentrations of total polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) (n=5 birds) were similar to background concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons previously found in yellow-eyed penguins from the South Island of New Zealand, but there were significantly higher concentrations of 1-methylnapthelene and 2-methylnapthelene in the birds found dead in this mortality cluster. The biological significance of this finding is unclear. A temporal investigation of the epidemic did not indicate either a common source or propagative epidemic pattern. Although our investigation did not definitively implicate a toxic or infectious agent, we could not rule out causes such as toxic marine organisms or mycoplasmosis. Further investigations should therefore by carried out in the event of future mortality clusters. }

The techniques employed for the characterization of these materials were ICP-MS, TEM, XRD, BET, and XAS. Au L3-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopic measurements were carried out over a series of rare earth materials containing gold nanoparticles. The size of gold nanoparticles varied in the range of ???2 to 6 nm in the Eu/Dy/Sm/Nd/Gd/La materials. These materials possess surface areas ranging from 29 to 41 m2/g with the high phase purity and crystallinity of the support (Eu/Dy/Sm/Nd/Gd/La) materials. An X-ray absorption fine structure (XANES, EXAFS) technique was used in obtaining critical information about the atomic distances, bonding and neighbouring environment for gold atoms in the rare earth Eu/Dy/Sm/Nd/Gd/La oxide materials for understanding the typical characteristics and structure of gold nanoparticles in these materials. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

@article{Efford1996,
abstract = {Conservation of yellow-eyed penguins ( Megadyptes antipodes) on the New Zealand mainland requires accurate data on population trend, annual variation in survival, and several other parameters that can be estimated from banding data. We describe initial analyses using a newly constructed database of yellow- eyed penguin breeding and banding data, maintained by Manaaki Whenua. All known banding records of fledglings, juveniles and adults (n = 5894, 1972- 1994) are tabulated by year for 46 mainland breeding areas and three southern islands (Codfish, Enderby and Campbell). Annual survival and recruitment were analysed for the intensively studied Double Bay and Midsection areas on Otago Peninsula. Adult survival varied between 49{\%} and 100{\%} over the 1982/83 - 1992/93 period; excluding one year of extraordinarily high mortality (1989/90), the lowest annual adult survival rate was 80{\%} in 1985/86 - 1986/87. The average adult survival rate (83 +/- 13{\%}) did not differ significantly from that reported 45 years earlier. The proportion of banded fledglings resighted as adults varied between 1 {\%} and 38{\%} in different cohorts, and almost half were resighted at an area other than their natal area. Mark-recapture estimates of total adult population showed no recovery from the 1989-90 catastrophe by the 1992-93 breeding season. We demonstrate that adult yellow-eyed penguins are likely to be male when the sum of head length and foot length exceeds 269 mm. The 14{\%} error rate by this criterion may be further reduced to about 2{\%} by measuring both birds of a definitely mated heterosexual pair and considering the larger to be the male. The proportion of adult-aged birds breeding in any year was extremely variable (30{\%} - 90{\%}); care must therefore be taken when applying Richdale's "60{\%}" rule of thumb for extrapolating the total population from the number of nests. We are unable to estimate separately the non-breeding rates of males and females as prior to 1992 relatively few adults were measured for sexing. We propose a new system of paper record forms for use by field workers.},
